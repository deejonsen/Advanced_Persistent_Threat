# APT34 Cybersecurity Analysis and Mitigation Report

Welcome to **APT34 Cybersecurity Analysis and Mitigation Report**! This repository contains a comprehensive report and supporting materials detailing the analysis of **APT34 (OilRig)**, a state-sponsored cyber threat group linked to Iran. The report evaluates the group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), assesses the impact of a simulated breach on a client organization, and provides actionable recommendations for mitigating future attacks.

## Whatâ€™s Inside:

### Research Methodology  

### 1. **OSINT Data Collection**  
- **Objective**: Gather intelligence on APT34's history, motives, and TTPs.  
- **Sources Used**:  
  - **Threat Intelligence Reports**: Mandiant, CrowdStrike, SecureWorks, and Symantec.  
  - **Government Advisories**: CISA Alert AA20-006A, US-CERT bulletins.  
  - **News Articles**: CyberScoop, Dark Reading, and The CyberWire.  
  - **Tools**: Recorded Future, ThreatConnect, and Kaspersky Lab threat feeds.  
- **Process**:  
  - Compiled historical campaigns (e.g., POWBAT malware, BONDUPDATER).  
  - Mapped APT34's infrastructure patterns (e.g., domain spoofing).  
  - Analyzed victimology (targeted industries: energy, finance, telecom).  

### 2. **MITRE ATT&CK Framework Integration**  
- **Objective**: Align APT34's TTPs with MITRE ATT&CK tactics for defensive strategy development.  
- **Process**:  
  - Identified relevant techniques (e.g., `Spear-phishing (T1566.002)`, `DNS Tunneling (T1048.003)`).  
  - Mapped defensive controls to each technique (e.g., email filtering for phishing).  

### 3. **Impact Assessment**  
- **Objective**: Evaluate the breach's consequences on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad).  
- **Process**:  
  - Simulated data exfiltration scenarios.  
  - Assessed risks of intellectual property theft and regulatory penalties (GDPR/CCPA).  

### 4. **Recommendations**  
- Derived from MITRE ATT&CK, NIST CSF, and industry best practices.  
- Prioritized measures like network segmentation, EDR deployment, and phishing training.

## Key Findings  
1. **APT34 Attribution**: Strongly linked to Iranian state interests, focusing on espionage.  
2. **Common Exploits**: Leverages unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers and spear-phishing.  
3. **Defense Gaps**: Client lacked network segmentation and endpoint monitoring.  

## Usage Instructions  
1. **View the Report**: Open `APT34_Analysis_Report.pdf` for detailed analysis.  
2. **Replicate Research**:  
   - Review OSINT data in `OSINT_Data/`.  
   - Use MITRE ATT&CK mappings to design defensive playbooks.  
3. **Implement Recommendations**:  
   - Deploy scripts in `Scripts/` for phishing detection and DNS monitoring.  

## **How to Use This Repository**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
